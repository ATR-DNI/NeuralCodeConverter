% FORMAT [img DIM VOX SCALE TYPE OFFSET ORIGIN] = read_image( fname )
%
% Reads image fname and header for fname, returning image as matrix
% img, mutliplied by SCALE, as well as header info
%
% Returns only as many output arguments as passed, e.g
% [img DIM VOX] = read_image( 'test.img' ) will behave as expected
